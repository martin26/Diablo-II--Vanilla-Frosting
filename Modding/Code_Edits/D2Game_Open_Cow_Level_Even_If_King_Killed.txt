WHAT TO DO:
Change 85C0 to 33CO (TEST -> XOR)

HOW TO FIND THE OFFSET:

Load up the DLL by File -> Open (Not: View -> File). This will load up the other required Blizzard dlls 
so make sure all the dlls are in the same directory as D2Game.dll.

Press Ctrl + S to search for a sequence of commands (Code Block), and search for: 

PUSH 0A
PUSH 4
PUSH EAX
CALL const
TEST EAX,EAX
JNZ const

There will be two instances of this, Look above the TEST EAX,EAX blocks and find one that has a E??+34. This will be the one you want to edit.
Once you find that, just look at the offset for TEST EAX,EAX and you are done.

TESTEAX ADDRESS - BASE ADDRESS = NEW OFFSET
6FC2EBE8 - 6FC20000 = EBE8

You can find the base address of D2Game.dll by pressing the E at the top of OllyDbg, and looking at the BASE column for D2Game.dll in the "Executable Modules" window.

OR

You can just select the lines that you found on the screen, right clicking them, and Copy To Executable -> Selection. 
This will open a new window as if it was opened by (View -> File), and it will be at the Offset address.

OR Right Click the line -> View -> Executable File

Either way, you should end up on the raw line.
